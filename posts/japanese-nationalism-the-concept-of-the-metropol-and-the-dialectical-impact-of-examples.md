summary: What do we learn by looking at the relationship between the concept of
  the metropole and Japanese nationalism? The question measures the dialectical
  impact of examples on each other because Japan as a nation-state is an
  exemplar of the metropole concept, and the question demands that one take
  Tokyo as an example of the metropole.
