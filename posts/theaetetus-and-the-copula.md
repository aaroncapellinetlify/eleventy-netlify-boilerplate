author: Aaron Capelli
summary: An SEP article on Plato’s dialogue ‘Theaetetus’ is identical in the
  substance of its topic to the Wikipedia article on the linguistic copula. What
  the SEP article says the ‘Theaetetus’ is saying, is what the Wikipedia article
  is saying. The copula expresses a thing considered as having a quality.
