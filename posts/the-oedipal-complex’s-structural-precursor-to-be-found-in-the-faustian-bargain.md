title: Can the Oedipal complex’s structural precursor be found in the Faustian
  bargain?

author: Aaron Capelli
summary: When Jung reads Freud, he does so in a way that sees him as essentially
  doing battle with the past, with the remains of our animal instincts. Whereas
  for Lacan, Freud’s subject is one intimidated by the possibility latent in
  language, always shirking from the unbounded horizon. Can a reading of the
  Oedipal complex as a structural successor of the Faustian bargain shed light
  on these issues?
