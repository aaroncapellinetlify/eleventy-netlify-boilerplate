summary: It's all in how we understand the word 'question' and what happens to
  its meaning from its materialization as a sort of metatextual questioning
  possibility in Plato (the dialogues are essentially each 'big questions') to a
  condensation into the single instance of the word question in Hamlet's central
  soliloquy, through which all of philosophy must flow to reach Hegel.
