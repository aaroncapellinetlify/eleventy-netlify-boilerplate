title: The Lyric Dialectic of Universality and Singularity in Rihanna’s ‘Loud’
  and ‘Good Girl Gone Bad’

author: Aaron Capelli
summary: Since every song on ‘Loud’ feels ‘really good,’ and only one song on
  ‘Good Girl Gone Bad’ feels ‘really good’ (“Umbrella”), these albums are
  representatives of the lyric dialectic by which a poem places a reader in a
  position that is universal and singular at the same time. It is because these
  positions are articulated as being on a value-spectrum, whereby Rihanna’s
  improvement as an artist is measured as being a leap from the singular to the
  universal, consisting of the variation from one good song to many, that the
  cultural implication of these albums strips these positions of their
  philosophical purity, destabilizing them from absolute identities into powers
  of magnitude, and it is for that reason that Rihanna is featured so centrally
  on Kanye West’s ‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’ album.
